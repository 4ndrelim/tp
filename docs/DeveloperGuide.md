### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The * * *Architecture Diagram* * * given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee`, `Department` or `Leave` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](./images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SudoHRParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an employee).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SudoHRParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SudoHRParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](./images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the system data i.e., all `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (which are contained in `UniqueEmployeeList`, `UniqueDepartmentList` and `UniqueLeaveList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>`, `ObservableList<Department>` or `ObservableList<Leave>`, that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](./images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both SudoHR data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SudoHRStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.SudoHR.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Department-related features

The `Department` object represents a department in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueDepartmentList`.



The attributes of a department are:
* `name`: The name of the department, which is also the unique identifier for a department.
* `employees`: The employees in a department, the list must not contain duplicate employees. It is implemented by reusing the `UniqueEmployeeList` datatype.

### Adding a department

![AddDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The call stack is the same as a typical command during parsing. It requires the department name prefix: `n/`.

Upon execution, it first checks if the department contains the employee being added. This is done to prevent the addition of duplicates. After the check is done, the model adds the employee to the department. 

After that, it returns the command result.

### Listing all departments

![ListDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The call stack is the same as a typical command except that it has no specified parser. Instead, `SudoHrParser` directly returns the command containing the required predicate.

Upon execution, it updates the department view.

After that, it returns the command result.

### Event-related features

The `Leave` object represents a leave date in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueLeaveList`.

The attributes of a leave are:
* `date`: The date of the leave, which is also the unique identifier for a leave
* `employees`: The employees who applied for this leave, the list must not contain duplicate employees. It is implemented by reusing the `UniqueEmployeeList` datatype.

### Cascading employee updates to department and event

#### Design considerations:

### Employee

An important design consideration to note for Employee is the multiple different types of equality checks.

An employee is identified by his ID field, and this field is used to get an employee with the specified Id.

However, other stronger forms of equality are used in the application. For example, when loading Employees from Storage, strict equality checks are used to ensure no two employees have the same ID, phone number or address.
