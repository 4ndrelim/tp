### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The * * *Architecture Diagram* * * given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee`, `Department` or `Leave` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](./images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SudoHRParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an employee).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SudoHRParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SudoHRParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](./images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the system data i.e., all `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (which are contained in `UniqueEmployeeList`, `UniqueDepartmentList` and `UniqueLeaveList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Employee`, `Department` and `Leave` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>`, `ObservableList<Department>` or `ObservableList<Leave>`, that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](./images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both SudoHR data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `SudoHRStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.SudoHR.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Employee-related features

The 'Employee' object represents an Employee in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueEmployeeList`.

The attributes of an Employee are:
* `Id`: The employee id, which is their unique identifier in the company.
* `Name`: The name of the employee.
* `Email`: The email of the employee, which should be unique.
* `Phone`: The phone of the employee, which should be unique.
* `Address`: The address of the employee.
* `Tags`: The tags assigned to the employee.


### Department-related features

![DepartmentModelClassDiagram](./images/commands/department/DepartmentModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Department` object represents a department in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueDepartmentList` managed by SudoHr.

The attributes of a department are:
* `DepartmentName`: The name of the department, which is also the unique identifier for a department.
* `UniqueEmployeeList`: The employees in a department, the list must not contain duplicate employees.

The uniqueness of each department in `UniqueDepartmentList` is enforced by checking against the `DepartmentName`. This will be explained in the _Adding a department_ section.

#### Adding a department

The `adep` command adds a new `Department` in SudoHr.

Activity Diagram:

![AddDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `adep n/Sales`
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the department name.
3. A `Department` object is constructed from the `DepartmentName` and handed over to the `AddDepartmentCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first checks if the department contains the employee being added. This is done to prevent the addition of duplicate
employees in the same department.
5. If there is no duplicate, the model adds the department to SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

When checking for duplicates in the `UniqueDepartmentList`, the `DepartmentName` of the department is used to uniquely
identify each department. This is because it is illogical to have 2 departments with the same name, as the application
is meant for use by a single company.

If duplicate arguments are present in the same command, the last instance of the duplicated argument is taken in by the parser.

#### Editing a department

The `edep` command edits the department-level details of an existing `Department` in SudoHr. Currently, you can only
edit the department name field as it is the only existing department-level detail.

Activity Diagram:

![EditDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/EditDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![EditDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/EditDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `edep Marketing n/Sales`. Marketing is the new department name and Sales is the old department name.
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the new department name.
3. A `EditDepartmentDescriptor` object is constructed from the `DepartmentName` and handed over to the `EditDepartmentCommand`.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the department called Marketing.
5. If the Marketing department exists, the command will then create the new department called Sales using the EditDepartmentDescriptor.
The non-edited attributes from Marketing will be passed down to Sales.
6. The command then checks if the edited department exists in SudoHR.
8. If there is no duplicate, the model adds the department to SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

The `EditDepartmentDescriptor` is used to store the details to be edited. This abstraction is used as not all fields
may be edited for the `EditDepartmentCommand`, hence we use this class to figure out what to pass down during the
construction of the new edited department. As of now, this class may be trivial but will prove more useful in the future
when more department-level details are added (e.g. creation date, director, work type, etc.).

It is also important to check if the name of the newly edited department clashes with any existing departments in
SudoHR, as the name is the unique identifier for a department.

#### Deleting a department

The `deldep` command deletes an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![DeleteDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/DeleteDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![DeleteDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/DeleteDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `deldep n/Sales`. Sales is the department to be deleted.
2. The parser will instantiate a new `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of the argument `/n` which represents the new department name.
3. The `DepartmentName` is passed down to the command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the department called Sales.
5. If the Sales department exists, it will be deleted from SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### Listing all departments

The `listdep` command lists all the departments in SudoHR.

![ListDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The call stack is the same as a typical command except that it has no specified parser. Instead, `SudoHrParser` directly returns the command containing the required predicate.

Upon execution, it updates the `filteredDepartmentList` in SudoHR.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### Adding an employee to a department

The `aetd` command adds an existing `Employee` to an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddEmployeeToDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/AddEmployeeToDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `aetd eid/100 n/Software Engineering`. It represents that the employee with ID 100
is supposed to be added to the Software Engineering department.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` and `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of arguments `eid/` and `n/` respectively.
3. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100 and department called Software Engineering.
4. If the employee and department exists, the command checks if the same employee exists in the department.
6. If there is no duplicate employee in the department, the model adds the employee to the department.

After that, the command result is returned.

##### Feature considerations

There was a major design decision, which is to use `UniqueEmployeeList` for the employee list inside a `Department`.
The idea is that a department should not contain duplicate employees. Hence, we made use of the existing
`UniqueEmployeeList` class in `SudoHr`, instead of creating a new employee list class for Department. This logic is
reused in `Leaves` as well.

It should be noted that we still used defensive checks such as `department.hasEmployee` despite the
`UniqueEmployeeList` having such checks internally already.

#### Removing an employee from a department

The `refd` command removes an `Employee` from an existing `Department` in SudoHR.

Activity Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/RemoveEmployeeFromDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `refd eid/100 n/Software Engineering`. It represents that the employee with ID 100
   is supposed to be removed from the Software Engineering department.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` and `DepartmentName` object constructed from the input of arguments `eid/` and `n/` respectively.
3. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100 and department called Software Engineering.
4. If the employee and department exists, the command checks if the same employee exists in the department.
6. If the employee exists in the department, the model removes the employee from the department.

After that, the command result is returned.

#### Listing an employee's departments

The `led` command

Activity Diagram:

![ListEmployeeDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListEmployeeDepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![ListEmployeeDepartmentCommand](./images/commands/department/ListEmployeeDepartmentSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command, eg. `led eid/100`. It represents listing all departments that contain employee
with ID 100.
2. The parser instantiates a new `Id` object constructed from the input of argument `eid/`.
3. The `Id` object is used to instantiate the `DepartmentContainsEmployeePredicate`, which will be used to filter
the `FilteredDepartmentList` later on.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the employee with ID 100.
5. If the employee exists, the `FilteredDepartmentList` will be updated and SudoHR will display all the departments
that employee with ID 100 is in.

After that, the command result is returned.


### Leave-related features

The `Leave` object represents a leave date in the company. They are all stored in a `UniqueLeaveList`.

The attributes of a leave are:
* `date`: The date of the leave, which is also the unique identifier for a leave
* `employees`: The employees who applied for this leave, the list must not contain duplicate employees. It is implemented by reusing the `UniqueEmployeeList` datatype.

#### Adding an employee's leave
The `aetd` command adds an employee's leave on a specific day:

Activity Diagram:
![AddEmployeeToLeaveCommand Activity Diagram](.//images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeToLeaveCommand Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeave.png)

##### Flow

1. The user enters the command `aetl eid/1 d/2022-03-04` where 1 is the employee id and 2022-03-04 is the leave date.
2. The parser would initialise a new `Id` and `LeaveDate` object constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and `d/` respectively
3. The `Id` and `LeaveDate` are passed down to the command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1 and the `Leave` that represents the date on which the leave is taken. If the `Leave` does not exist, a new one is created and added to `SudoHR`. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If the employee already exists in `Leave`, an error message will be displayed.
6. Assuming if Step 5 completes without exception, the employee would be added to the `Leave`.
7. `FilteredEmployeeList` will be updated to only display all employees having leave on the input date.

##### Feature considerations
We decided to throw an exception when the employee has already taken leave on the same day as the input date, since the user may have accidently provided a wrong date and hence the exception would be more suitable as it would be more noticeable than the success message.

#### Deleting an employee's leave
The `defl` command delete an employee's leave on a specific day:

Activity Diagram:
![RemoveEmployeeFromLeaveCommand Activity Diagram](.//images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![RemoveEmployeeFromLeaveCommand Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/DeleteEmployeeFromLeave.png)

##### Flow

1. The user types and enters the command `defl eid/1 d/2022-03-04` where 1 is the employee id and 2022-03-04 is the leave date.
2. The parser would initialise a new `Id` and `LeaveDate` constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and `d/` respectively
3. The `Id` and `LeaveDate` are passed down to the newly created command.
4. The command is executed. It first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1 and the `Leave` that represents the date on which the leave is taken. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
5. If the employee does not exists in `Leave` (The employee has yet take leave on the input date), an error will be thrown too.
6. Assuming if Step 5 completes without exception, the employee would be added to the `Leave`.
7. `FilteredEmployeeList` will be updated to only display all employees having leave on the input date.

#### Adding an employee's leave in a range
The `aelr` command adds an employee's leave on all the days between the range of a start date to an end date inclusive.

Activity Diagram:
![AddEmployeeLeaveFromTo Activity Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

Sequence Diagram:

![AddEmployeeLeaveFromTo Sequence Diagram](./images/commands/leave/AddEmployeeToLeaveFromTo.png)

##### Flow

1. The user types and enters the command `aelr eid/1 s/2022-03-04 e/2022-03-06` where 1 is the employee id, 2022-03-04 is the start date and 2022-03-06 is the end date.
2. The parser checks that the end date `e/` is after the start date represented by `s/`.The end date `e/` also must be less than 7 days away from the start date `s/`. If both conditions are not satisfied, an error message will be shown.
3. The parser would initialise a `Id` constructed from the input of argument `eid/` and a list of `LeaveDate` objects representing every single day in the range between `s/` and `e/` with the end and start dates inclusive.
4. The `Id` and list of `LeaveDate` are passed down to the newly created command.
5. The command is executed. The command first tries to find the `Employee` with ID 1. If the `Employee` does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
6. The command then checks if the employee has taken leave on any of the days in the range between the start date `s/` and end date `e/` inclusive. If this is the case, an error message would be thrown.
7. Assuming step 6 completes with no exception, `Employee` is added to `Leave` on all the days in the range of the start day to end date inclusive
8. SudoHr will show all the days on which the employee has successfully taken leave.

##### Feature considerations
We intentionally decide to limit the range of days to be added to be 1 week. This is because we wanted to prevent excessively large ranges that are illogical such as taking leaves throughout multiple years. Hence we decided that 1 week would be the most appropriate number as it is the typical length of leave taken when people go on vacation.

We also decided to not add leaves on all of the days in the range if the employee has taken leave on any of the days. We decided to do this to keep the behavior consistant with AddEmployeeToLeave command. In the case that the user would actually like to extend the leave for an employee, the addition would only require two additional commands so this would be of minimal inconvenience to the user.

#### Listing all employees taking leave on a specific day

The `leol` command lists employees taking leave on a specific date.

1. The user types and enters the command `leol 2022-04-02` where 2022-04-02 is the date input provided.
2. The parser would initialise a `LeaveDate` object constructed from the input argument.
3. The command is executed. It initializes a new `LeaveContainsEmployeePredicate` that will filter out employees that have not taken leaves on the specified date.
4. The command uses the `LeaveContainsEmployeePredicate` to filter the employees and display the employees that have taken leave on the specified day.

#### Cascading employee updates to department and event

#### Design considerations:

##### Employee
An important design consideration to note for Employee is the multiple different fields that qualify as a primary key (unique identity).

An employee is identified by his ID field, and this field is used to get an employee object.

However, there are other fields to guard against duplication, specifically email and phone number fields.
For instance, two employees should not share email field or phone number as those two fields are known to be unique.

##### Departments

##### Leaves

##### Cascading employee updates and deletion to department and leave
An important functionality is to ensure updates to employee is cascaded down to department-level and leave-level because
each department and leave has its own list of employees. This issue becomes more prominent during loading of storage files
where employee objects are separately created for department's and leave's employee lists.
Hence, any modification to an employee after SudoHR is initialized from storage needs to be cascaded down to modify the equivalent employee object.
